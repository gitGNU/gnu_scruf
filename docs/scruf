Scruffy is a mark-up that is out right shabby and squalid, it is, in a
way inspired from the markup used in MoinMoin and MediaWiki. If it is
desired that the text version of the HTML files, that are to be,
generated, look sane enough to be interpreted as ''plain text'', it is
suggested that you look for static HTML generators that accept
Markdown. Markdown looks sane. Scruffy, as the name implies, is an
insane markup.

With that, I leave you, to make a choice, whether you wish to use
Scruffy, and thus Scruf, at all.
