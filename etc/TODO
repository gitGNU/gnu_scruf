SCRUF - TODO		-*- mode: org; -*-

* features
** server/ directory
   this is the directory where the stylesheet, #include files are
   place.
*** one stylesheet for a directory and all its subdirectory.
   At present, each directory, irrespective of whether it is a
   subdirectory or not, has one stylesheet. This is just bad design.
*** #include feature which smears HTML from another file.
** HTML in scruffy
   At present scruffy markup files should not contain any HTML. I
   guess that's stupid design.

   Therefore, need to enable HTML markup in scruffy.
* documentation
** list mark up should be documented.
* bugs
** the Paragraphs parser has a serious bug, which is creating un-acceptable delays in parsing.
